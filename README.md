Fraud Detection using Machine learning models

The main objective of the Fraud Detection is to predict the fraudulant transactions. 


The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models (logistic regression)

4. evaluating the models

5.final model creation and analysis outcome.

 Final result:

The accuracy of the model os 0.9991
